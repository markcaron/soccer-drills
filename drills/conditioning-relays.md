# Conditioning Relays

## Purpose

Conditioning is one of the most important aspects of soccer. In fact, we all know conditioning is essential to be able to play our best, yet is often overlooked in youth programs (most especially Recreation leagues). Why? Because, typically, it isn't fun. Sometimes it even feels like torture! But, a well conditioned team will not only perform better, the players will be happier because they're healthier and performing at higher levels.

So let's make conditioning fun by making it a relay race!

## Setup & Players

Using 4 cones, set up a rectangle with two end lines that are approximately 40 to 50 yards apart (or half field). The width of the rectangle is dependent on how many players and relay teams you want to make. So, with 12-15 players, you'd want 3 to 5 teams of 3 players. Distributing teams evenly is important, so if numbers are uneven, you can participate as a coach—which is always fun for the players and it shows the players you're willing to do conditioning too. If you have extra cones, you can divide up the rectangle for each team to have their own "channel" for the relay (optional).

## How to Play

Have the teams lineup, in their respective lines/channels, on one side of the rectangle (typically the goal line). Start with a standard running race. On the coach's whistle, the first player on each team will run/work their way down to the other end line (half field) and back, and tag their teammate to continue the relay. The teams that completes the relay first wins.

Select the next progression you want to move on to, like Dribbling or "Mountain Climbers."

You can keep a total score if you think it'll help encourage the players to work harder or just let a single relay win be a win and move on.

## Progressions

- **Running Backward**
- **Dribbling** — Players must dribble the ball down and back. You can make other progressions from dribbling, like inside of the foot only, rolling the ball while running sideways, etc.
- **Mountain Climbers** — Players must be on all fours with their back as straight as possible while moving (no arching), alternating hands and feet.
- **Frankenstein's Monster** — Players must have their hands held straight out with their palms facing the ground, moving by lifting one leg at a time straight out (like Frankenstein's Monster).
- **Crab Walk** — Players must be on all fours underneath them, like a crab while moving.
- **High-jump Skipping** — Players will skip concentrating on jumping as high as possible with their knee going up as high as possible and their plant leg remaining as straight as possible.
- **Bunnies** — Players must hold the ball between their feet (or knees) and hop down and back. If they lose the ball, they must stop and replace the ball before continuing.
- **Spider** — Two players at a time. One player stands backward and the other forward, and they link arms. When they reach the end, they don't turn around, but instead run back exactly as they are, so the one running backward is now running forward.
- **Wheelbarrow** — Two players at a time. One player gets into a push-up position, while a partner picks up and holds their ankles. It's important to ensure that the the pace is set by the player in the push-up position (the other player must not push or run too fast). Once they reach the first end line, they would switch roles.
- **Piggyback** — Two players at a time. If your team is able to do so, one player caries the other player on their back (piggyback) down to one endline before they switch roles.
- **Push-ups & Go** - Players must perform a specficied number of push-ups before they get to run down and back.
- **Sit-ups & Go** — Same as above with sit-ups.
- **Burpees & Go** — Same as above with burpees. Burpees begin by standing upright, drop to a squat-like position with your hands on the ground in front, then kick your feet back into a push-up/plank position (with arms still extended), then back to a squat (you can add an optional jump in the air with your hands above your head to make it harder).

## Duration

This can be used as a warmup for 10-15 minutes during a normal practice, or part of a full conditioning session. Choose as many progressions as will fit within your time slot.

## Coaching Points

- Focus on form of each progression. While each is silly (or may feel silly), there is a right way to do each to get the most out of the exercise. Not having good form will either not be as effective or could lead to a potential injury.
- Encourage the players to work hard. Remind them that the benfits of conditioning aren't always seen immediately, and that the gratification of their hard work may be delayed.
- Encourage, encourage, encourage. "Keep it up!" "Keep working hard!" "You got this!"
