# Finishing Wars

## Purpose

A fun, fast-paced attacking (and defending) drill that incorporates a lot of different skills like passing, communication, providing support, receiving/turning, and finishing. Plus, your goalkeepers will get a workout too!

Note: I created this drill for my U14 Challenge team as a way to develop their combination play in and around the box, and to encourage lay-offs for shots at the top of the box (something we were struggling with). I got the idea from one of my favorite drills as a goalkeeper: [Goalkeeper Wars](goalkeeper-wars.md).

## Setup

Set up two age-appropriate goals directly facing each other on opposite ends of the penalty area; one on the goal line and the other about 30 yards away.

Using 4 cones, mark the 4 corners of the playing area, which should be about 25–30 yards wide by 30 yards long. Using 4–5 more cones, make a line down the middle across the width of the playing area—dividing it into two halves/zones.

Evenly distribute soccer balls between goals (inside the goal). You may need or want as many soccer balls as you can get to keep the speed of play going—helping with conditioning.

## Players

You'll need 2 goalkeepers, one protecting each goal. Divide up your remaining players into teams of 4-5. If you have more players, you can sub them in/out or make a third team (if you have enough) that challenges the winner. You'll want at least 1 or 2 forwards or attack-minded players on each team.

Give one team pinnies.

The players will line up with 3 defenders in their defensive zone, and one striker in their offensive zone (if you have 5 to a team, you can have 2 strikers). This will make it 3 v 1 (or 3 v 2) in each zone.

## How to Play

The objective is to score as many goals as possible. Players cannot cross the halfway line/markers. They must stay in their zone.

If you have a 3rd team, you can play to 5 or 6 points before rotating.

Goal values are as follows:

- 1 point - Goal scored within the offensive zone.
- 2 points - Goal scored from defensive zone (long distance shot)
- 3 points - Goal scored from a lay-off (passed into the striker who lays it off for the long distance shot)
- 3 points (optional) - Amazing combination play, like a give-go/wall pass that frees up the striker in the box or a goal off of a cross.

Once a goal is scored, the goalkeeper who got scored on can restart as quickly as possible by distributing to whomever he/she wants (roll, throw, pass-in, etc.). Goalkeepers can shoot, but they cannot punt/drop-kick to score.

## Duration

You can play for 15 to 20 minutes. Take water breaks as needed—it's a lot of running and constant play.

## Coaching Points

- The original purpose of the drill was to encourage long distance shots and lay-offs/combination play.
- You may want to demonstrate combination possibilities if these types of concepts are new to the team.
  - Wall passes
  - Lay-offs
  - Turn vs. "Man on" pass back
  - Strikers checking-to to receive and turn
  - Strikers making runs to open up space. For example, moving away from the intended space to open it up, and then changing direction quickly to receive a pass and get a shot quickly
