# Goalkeeper Wars

## Purpose

An incredibly fun, fast-paced goalkeeper game that combines several technical skills like reflexes, diving/shot stopping and distribution. Your goalkeepers will be begging to play this every day!

## Setup

Depending on the age group, set up two age-appropriate goals directly facing each other on opposite ends of the penalty area; one on the goal line and the other on the top line. If your goalkeepers are U9-U11, the play area size will be about 12 yards long (from goal to goal) and about 18–20 yards wide. For U12 and older, the play area size will be about 18 yards long (from goal to goal) and about 25 yards wide. You can mark the sidelines with cones (optional).

Evenly distribute soccer balls between goals (inside the goal). You may need or want as many soccer balls as you can get to keep the speed of play going—helping with conditioning.

## Players

With a minimum of 2 goalkeepers and about a maximum of 6, you can divide them up into teams (1v1, 2v2). If playing with more than 2 total goalkeepers, it's possible to play 2v2 at the same time or rotate out goalkeepers that get scored on (almost like tag). Another option would be to rotate goalkeepers after 5 to 10 minutes or play first to score 3 goals. With 3 total goalkeepers, a "winner stays" format is also fun.

Basically, feel free to rotate the goalies however you see fit, so they all have an opportunity to play each other. You can even make a mini tournament out of it!

Goalkeepers who are not currently playing, should stand to the sides, behind their respective goal lines, and they should be ready to shag missed shots and deflections (to keep the pace going).

## How to Play

Following a coin toss, paper/rock/scissors or picking a number behind the coach's back, play begins with the ball in one of the goalkeeper's hands. From here, the keeper in possession has several options of shooting within 5 yards of their own goal:

1. Goalkeeper throw (overhand, javelin, sidearm, etc.)
2. Drop kick
3. Shot from the ground

Rules on types of shots allowed can vary depending on the skill of the goalkeepers and the techniques that the coach is wanting to build upon. For instance, limiting shots to goalkeeper throws decreases the speed of the shots, increases accuracy, and improves the goalkeepers' throwing techniques. You may also find that the skill level becomes more approachable due to the decreased speed and closeness of the shots.

The goalkeepers must stay within 5 yards of their own goal when attacking/shooting unless there is a rebound, which they're allowed to follow up and take from wherever it lands. If the ball is saved or goes out of bounds (whether missed or tipped), possession belongs to the goalkeeper who was just shot on (rotating who shoots). If you have plenty of balls inside the goal, it makes it easier for keepers to quickly grab a new ball (if a shot goes wide) and resume play.

Rotate your goalies how ever you decide. "Winner stays," First to 3, "Scorer stays," 2v2, etc. Just make it fun and fast!

## Duration

Depends entirely on how you want to rotate goalkeepers, though intervals longer than 10 minutes quickly become exhausting.

## Coaching Points

- Proper diving techniques
- Proper distribution techniques, especially in goalkeeper throws
- Positioning within the goal
- Maintaining the right goalkeeper stance, balls of the feet, hands ready, knees slightly bent, etc.
- Recover quickly and get set, whether after a rebound or to quickly take a shot while the opponent is out of position.

## Progressions

- Use shooting options (throws, drop kicks, shooting from the ground) as progressions of speed of shots. Drop kicks are usually the hardest to control for some keepers, but the fastest paced and hardest to save (especially from 18 yards).
- Play 2v2 (3v3 is not recommended) to limit the amount of goal needed to cover (making it harder to score), as well as require a lot of communication between the goalkeepers ("I got it!") and awareness of traffic in the box. This is only recommended with advanced or older goalkeepers.
