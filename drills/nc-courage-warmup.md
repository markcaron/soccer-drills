# NC Courage Warmup

## Background & Purpose

An incredibly dynamic passing that combines passing, communication, receiving (one touch and two touch) and running. It may seem complicated at first due to the amount of movement required for each of the players as they make their way around the circuit, but it will make quite a bit of sense once you begin.

Note: This drill was observed and recreated here from watching the NC Courage of the NWSL warmup. They used this drill before every game in their Championship-winning 2018 season, and they've continued to use it throughout their 2019 season as well.

## Setup

You'll need at least 2 soccer balls. Set up a 24 yard wide by 16 yard long box with 4 cones. Then put a cone halfway along each sideline, so there are 8 cones total marking the playing area.

In the ASCII diagram below, the important cones have been marked Aâ€“F with 2 cones marked with Os that are unused (just there for the box shape). Cones A, B and C are one half of the circuit, and cones D, E and F are the other, mirror-image half of the circuit.

```
O------------A------------E
|                         |
|                         |
C                         F
|                         |
|                         |
B------------D------------O
```

## Players

You'll need at least 8 to 10 players. While this drill could be done with a full team, it's better to get divide the team in half and get two separate circuits going.

Have a minimum of 2 player each at cones A, D, B and E. No players at C and F. Depending on the number of players you have, you can adjust as needed, but try to have the same or more players on cones B and E (where most of the action takes place).

The players first in line at cones A and D start with a ball each.

## How to Play

![NC Courage Warmup diagram showing pattern of passing described below](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/markcaron/soccer-drills/master/drills/assets/NCCourageWarmup.png)

On the coach's whistle/command:

1. The first players in line at cones B and E will make a jog/run to the cones halfway on their sideline. So, E will go to F, and B will go to C.
2. Once the run is initiated, the first players in line at A and D will make a diagonal pass to the player making the run on their respective half; Player A will pass to the player running to C, and D will make a pass to the player running to F.
3. The players receiving the ball (at C and F) will make a short one-time wall pass back to the player who made the pass (A and D respectively), and C and F will make a curving, overlapping run behind their teammate (A and D).
4. A and D will then make a one-touch pass to the next player in line at B and E respectively, and follow their pass to get in the back of the line at B and E.
5. The players receiving the ball at B and E will make a one-touch pass to C and F on their overlapping runs. B and E will continue a slow jog toward cones C and F.
6. C and F (who made the overlapping run) will receive and make a pass (preferably one-touch) to the second player in line right in front of them at A and D (moving the ball from one half of the circuit to the next). So, the ball that went from D to F to E is last passed to A. And, A to C to B is completed at D.
8. The play continues in this mirror-image circuit from A and D again, with B and E having already jogged to C and F (in step 5).

## Duration

Run this warmup for about 10 minutes. You can take a break midway if needed.

## Coaching Points

- Encourage communication
- Proper one-touch technique, trying to keep the ball from bouncing too much
- Players making the overlapping run should change speed quickly they can get to the ball in time

## Progressions

- For first timers, go slow for a few round, and then pick up the speed once the players get the hang of it
- For more advanced players, try having the one-touch pass at cones C and F bounce/pop up a little to increase the difficulty of controlling the next pass
