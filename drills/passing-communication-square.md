# Passing & Communication Square

## Purpose

Simple passing drill for all ages that combines passing, communication, dribbling, turning & receiving, and finding open teammates. Can be used as an ice breaker at the beginning of the season, as well as a drill for improving all aspects of a player's development, including thinking quickly and reacting to available space/pressure.

## Setup

Depending on the number of players you have, set up an outers square with 4 cones. I've found that a 10 yards by 10 yards sqaure is good for 8 players, a 15 yards by 15 yards square suits 12â€“14 players, and that a 15 yards by 15 yards square is best for larger numbers of players.

You can tighten or widen the squares to suit your needs, makig the drill more challenging or less challenging respectively, or to increase the length of passing and/or cardio conditioning.

## Players

With a minimum of 8 players to a maximum of about 20 players, divide players evenly in to 2 groups. The first group will be inside the outer square with a ball each. The second group will space themselves evenly around the outside of the outer square (along the sides). Player bibs/pinnies are optional.

## How to Play

On the coach's whistle, players on the inside of the square will begin dribbling their ball, looking for an open teammate on the outside of the square to pass to. Before passing, the player with the ball must call out the name of the player he/she intends to pass to. The receiving player will use one or two touches (depending on skill or progression) and call out the name of the player who just passed them the ball before returning the ball back with a pass. After receiving the ball back, the player must turn (with or without a move) and look for an open teammate on one of the opposite or adjacent sides to pass to (repeating the calling of names before passing).

## Duration

Rotate players on the outside with players on the inside every 3 minutes.

## Coaching Points

- Try to communicate before the pass, so their teammate knows to expect the ball
- Keep your head up when dribbling in the square, so you don't collide with other players
- Use all sides of your foot (inside, outside, instep) to trap, turn and pass
- Change speed after receiving and turning
- Players on the outside should remain on the balls of their feet and ready to provide support
- Players on the outside can call out players on the inside letting them know they're open

## Progressions

- Two touch can progress to one touch (or wall pass)
- Practice specific turns and/or moves, like a Cruyff turn or toe turn
- Have players on the outside call out "turn", "man on", "pass back", or even specific set of moves for the player to perform
- Tighten the outer square to increase the difficulty

## Inner Square Variation

Optionally, you can set up an inner square with 4 cones in the middle that is approximately 3 yards by 3 yards (for smaller numbers) to 5 yards by 5 yards for larger numbers.

```

      .     .

      .     .


.                  .
```

In this set up, players receiving the ball inside the square must dribble through the smaller inner square (with their head up, so they don't collide with others) before looking for an open teammate to pass to.

With this variation you can also require the players to do a move inside the inner square (making it tougher to time properly) with the added awareness and tension in a smaller space.
