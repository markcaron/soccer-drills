# Passing Triangle

## Purpose

Passing drill that helps enforce the foundational concept of triangles in passing, and combines it with ball control and turning. The added passing combination progression provides a more dynamic level of support, give-and-go passing and movement.

## Setup

Depending on the number of players you have (minimum of 4), set up a triangle with 3 cones spaced apart by 15 yards on each side. If you have more players, you can set up additional triangles with 4-5 players and a single ball per triangle.

```
        B
        .



C .           . A
```

## Players

On each triangle, two of the cones will have one player and the third cone will have the remaining 2-3 players forming a line away from the cone to give the player at the front of the line room to play (behind player A in the diagram below).

The cones are defenders. No one should be standing **on** the cone.

```
        B
        .



C .           . A   X X
```

## How to Play

The ball begins with the player at the front of the line (player A in the diagram below). Moving counter-clockwise, the ball is passed outside the triangle to player B at the next cone. Player A follows her pass to the next cone. Meanwhile, player B receives, moves around the cone in 1-2 touches, and makes a pass to player Câ€”following her pass as well. Player C does the same, and passes to the next player in line (marked with X X in the diagram below). The passing/movement works its way around the triangle (passing and following their pass).

### Combination Passing Progression (optional)

An optional progression would be to add a realistic "wall passing" combination, where player A in the diagram above makes a pass to player B (like normal), and as player A follows his/her pass, player B one-touch passes it back to player A (midway through his/her run). Player A, then one-touch passes the ball at an angle through the corner of triangle to player B who makes a run in the direction of player C. Once player B receives the ball, he/she passes to player C. Player C one-touches it back to player B, and player B one-touch passes the ball at an angle through that corner of the triangle for player C making a run. This combination continues at each cone around the triangle.

## Duration

Have the passing continue counter-clockwise for 5 minutes, then stop the play and have them pass in the opposite direction (clockwise). Continue for another 5 minutes. Then, if the players are capable, move to the next progression: combination passing for another 5 minutes in each direction.

## Coaching Points

- Try to communicate before the pass, so their teammate knows to expect the ball.
- Use all sides of your foot (inside, outside, instep) to trap, turn and pass.
- Once they get the drill, encourage them to pass, move and follow their pass at game speed.
- Players on around the triangle should remain on the balls of their feet and ready to play / provide support.
- In the combination passing progression, sometimes play needs to move wider than the triangle as players mess up a touch and need their support player to shift or move wider. Encourage the players to be flexible with their shape (the triangle is just a guide).
- The cones are defenders. No one should be standing **on** the cone.

## Progressions

- Emphasize outside of the foot trap/control
- Combination passing (see instructions under Combination Passing Progression)
