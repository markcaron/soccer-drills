# Power, Finesse

## Purpose

A fun, competitive shooting game that works on both long distance shots (power) and inside-the-box finishing (finesse) that is a fantastic reward for hard work at the end of a session. Be ready to have your team begging to play this at each practice!

## Setup

Place two cones 8 yards apart (width of the goal) and about 25 to 30 yards away from the goal (for younger players, make it 15 to 20 yards).

Collect as many soccer balls as you can, and place them just to the outside of one of the posts (marked "C" on the diagram below).

```

|   |                 |   |
|   |                 |   |
|    -----------------    |
|                         |
|          .   .          |
|          X   O          |
```

## Players

With a goalkeeper in goal, divide the rest of your players up into two teams (as evenly as possible), and have them take there positions in a line behind one of the cones (marked with an "X" and an "O" in the diagram below).

The coach or an assisntant coach will be incharge of distributing balls beside the post (marked "C" below).

## How to Play

Decide which team goes firstâ€”flip a coin, pick a number, etc. __(Let's say it's team X)__

To begin, the coach will call out the name of the player at the front of the line for the team __X__, as a check if they're "ready". Then the coach will roll one ball firmly (with some pace) to the top of the box as the player runs forward to take a shot with __power__. The player must shoot with one touch! Shortly after the first ball is rolled, the coach will roll out a second ball between the 6 yard box and the penalty spot (shouldn't be too firm). The player will continue his/her run after the first shot in order to finish (with __finesse__) the second ball (as if a rebound).

It's important that the players take only one touch for both of their shots.

*Game rules*
- If a player misses both shots, he/she is eliminated (and will go behind the goal to help shag missed shots).
- If a player makes only one shot, they're still in, and will go to the back of the line.
- If a player makes *both* shots, they get to "bonus" challenge any opponent to make both as well.
  - When a player is challenged, it is a "bonus" chance to knockout an opponent.
  - The challenged player must make both shots. If they miss any, they're out.
  - If team X scored both and issued the challenge to team O, team O will be next up regardless of the results of the challenge (it's a "bonus" challenge).
- The teams take turns shooting until there is only one team left (their opponents have all been eliminated).
- If the last player left on a team misses both shots, he/she is not eliminated until their next opponent makes at least one shot.
  - If their opponent misses both, he/she is out, and the next player in line has to make at least one for that last player to be eliminated.
  - If it gets down to 1 player each, one player has to make at least one shot to eliminate their opponent.

If you have more than one goalkeeper, rotate goalies after each full game (or whenever you feel it is good timing to rotate them).

## Progressions & Variations

- For added fun, you can make it that if a player is challenged, and they make both their shots, the player that challenged them is eliminated!
- If players resort to "toe bashing" a shot or other poor technique, feel free to make that an automatic elimination.

## Duration

You can play for as long as you like. 15-20 minutes is pretty typical. But, be prepared for your players to keep wanting to play more and more rounds!

## Coaching Points

- One touch
- Leave the ball if you miss, focus on the next (because you don't have time and it's one touch)
- Focus on proper shooting techniques
- Inside of the foot finishing for finesse
- Laces/instep or inside of the foot shots for power
