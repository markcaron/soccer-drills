# Rondo Teams

Based off the original [rondo drill](rondo.md), this variant turns 2 separate rondo circles into a single competition, but with fewer players.

This drill also teaches the defenders how to win back possession and recycle the ball by "switching fields" of play, in addition to the communication and awareness around who will become those defenders who win back the ball.

## Setup

Using 4 cones, mark the corners of a playing area that is 20 yards wide by 30 yards long. Then divide the length of the playing area in half (at 15 yards) by the remaining 4 cones.

Place all the balls off to the side and the midpoint with the coach.

```

```

## Players

Divide up your players into 2 even teams of 5 (or 6), and have them move into their respective "halves" of the playing area.

If you have more than 10-12 players, you can have one team sit out or run a variation of this drill with a neutral zone (more on this under [Progressions](#progressions))

## How to Play

1. The coach starts off the play by calling out a player's name (at random) and passing the ball to that player (in their half)
2. This player's team is now "offense" and the play is "live"
3. The other team ("defense") must send in only two players ("defenders") to press and recover possession of the ball.
4. Once the defense recovers possession, they must get the ball out of pressure quickly by "switching fields" of play and passing the ball to their teammates in their half
5. The team that lost possession will then send 2 defenders to recover the possession
6. If possession is lost out of bounds, the coach will play the ball to a random player in the opposite half

Play should look very much like the original [rondo](rondo.md)â€”a simple 5 vs 2 "keep away". Only now, the players are allowed to move more fluidly to create better passing triangles and utilize **all** the available space in their half (not strictly a circle).

## Duration

Run the drill for about 10-15 minutes. It may take a while before players get the hang of the drill.

## Progressions

- Keep score. Count every 5 passes as a "goal"
- Add bonus points for megs or splitting defenders

### Neutral Zone Option

If you have enough players, you can expand this drill into a slight variant involving neutral zone. Simply expand the 20x30 playing area to a 20x35 playing area (creating a 5 yard neutral zone).

```
.                  .


.     .      .     .

.     .      .     .


.                  .
```

Having a neutral zone offers more difficulty in getting a pass out of pressure through players in the neutral zone (cutting off passing lanes) to their teammates in their half. You can run this option a couple of different ways:

- **Option 1:** 2 teams of 5 or 6 plus 2-3 neutral zone players
  - Run similarly to the main variation, but now there are 2-3 neutral zone players to block passing lanes out of one half to the other
  - The defenders will have to look up and make sure they don't collide with the neutral players as they run through this zone
  - After 5 minutes, rotate the neutral players
- **Option 2:** 3 teams of 5 or 6, where the "neutral zone" holds the defenders
  - The 2 halves are now working together, and once they connect 5 passes in one half, they must attempt to "switch fields" to the other half
  - Only two defenders from the neutral zone are allowed in the half with the ball
  - When the neutral zone defenders win possession, they must make a pass to their teammates in the neutral zone
  - After each loss of possession, neutral zone players return to the neutral zone, and the coach plays the ball into a random player
  - Switch out the neutral zone team after 5 minutes

## Coaching Points

- Use all the available space in their half! Remind them that this is the same as a basic rondo, but now with more space!
- Pay attention: everyone should pay attention and be ready for a pass
- Support: encourage players to provide support to their neighbor who receives the ball
- Receiving: players should receive/trap the ball "open" (hips) to where they'd like to make the next pass. Watch for players' touches that keep them closed off and facing the player who just passed them the ball
- First touch: encourage good first touches that allow for a positive next touch or easy pass
- Communication: everyone should be communicating on/off the ball
