# Rondo

Rondos are a fun, rather quickly paced, and extremely flexible type of drill that teaches _almost_ everything you need to know about soccer.

There are multiple variations of a "rondo," but this is its most basic form. Growing up, we called this "5v2". I later learned, as a coach, that this is known world-wide as a [rondo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rondo_(game)), and made famous by Johan Cruyff at Barçelona.

> "Everything that goes on in a match, except shooting, you can do in a rondo. The competitive aspect, fighting to make space, what to do when in possession and what to do when you haven’t got the ball, how to play ‘one touch’ soccer, how to counteract the tight marking and how to win the ball back."
> — <cite>Johan Cruyff</cite>

Rondos so valuable, in my opinion, that they (the rondo variants) should be a part of every training session.

## Setup

The basic rondo requires almost nothing to set up! All you need is a minimum of 7 players, a ball and some space to play.

Simply form a circle about 8-10 yards in diameter with 5 players on the outside, 2 players on the inside (defenders), and the ball starting at the feet of an outside player.

For younger or lower skilled players, you will need to adjust the circle size and/or the number of players on the outside.

### Number of Players vs Skill Level ###

Depending on the number of players you have as well as the skill level (or age level) of your team, there are subtle tweaks you can make to ensure "success" in this drill. These two factors are inversely related and can be simplified into three primary considerations:

- Higher skilled players require fewer in the drill (7 per circle)
- Younger or lower skilled players usually require more players in the drill to increase the number advantage of those with the ball (8-10 per circle)
- The larger the circle diameter the easier it is for the players on the outside

Therefore, use circle width in addition to number of players on the outside to adjust difficulty. While the drill can be played with a single defender, it's much better if there are two defenders that work together to cut off angles and passing lanes.

See [Progressions and Options](#progressions-and-options) below for more details on adjusting for skill level and age.

## How to Play

The player on the outside with the ball starts off with a "free pass" to any of his/her teammates on the outside. Once received the play is live and the defenders begin trying to narrow down passing lanes until they can steal the ball.

When the ball is stolen, a player makes a bad pass, or a player doesn't control the ball properly they will switch places with one of the defenders (usually the one who has been in the longest). Once they switch, play continues with a free pass.

## Duration

Run the drill for about 10-15 minutes. It may take a while before players get the hang of the drill.

## Progressions and Options

### Advanced or older teams

- More than 7 players? Try to make 2 circles (~14 players). You can use coaches to make up the difference
- If you don't have enough for 2 circles try substituting players in/out of the circle, use more than 5 on the outside (though no more than 6-7) with a tigher circle, or use a single circle as part of a circuit (small "keep away")
- Tighten the circle as much as possible to increase speed of play (giving less time to think)
- Move to two touch or one touch only
- Award bonus points (or scoring) for splitting defenders with a pass or getting [megged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutmeg_(association_football))

### Less advanced or younger teams

First, be patient. Very patient. It takes a while for this drill to become truly successful, as players need to adjust to needing to think and pass quickly.

- Use more players on the outside. I've used 8-10 vs 2 with U8, 8 vs 2 with U9, and 6-7 vs 2 with U10
- Try widening the circle to give players more time to think while the ball is at their feet
- Have defenders only pressure, not allowing them to steal the ball
- Use only one defender if just beginning, and slowly introduce a second
- Be lenient on what a "bad pass" or "bad trap" looks like. Give them time to correct errors
- Be lenient on number of touches
- As players get the hang of the pace, try tightening the circle some or limiting touches to 3-4 only
- Award bonus point for splitting defenders with a pass

## Coaching Points

- Pay attention: everyone should pay attention and be ready for a pass
- Support: encourage players to provide support to their neighbor who receives the ball
- Support for younger or less advanced players: talk about "flexing" the circle some (obtuse triangles) to make the pass eaiser for their neighbor
- Think quick: players should think as quickly as possible
- Receiving: players should receive/trap the ball "open" (hips) to where they'd like to make the next pass. Watch for players' touches that keep them closed off and facing the player who just passed them the ball
- First touch: encourage good first touches that allow for a positive next touch or easy pass
- Communication: everyone should be communicating on/off the ball
