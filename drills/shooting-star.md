# Shooting Star

## Purpose

A fun shooting drill that focuses on receiving a pass, turning and finishing on goal as quickly as possible in a tight space.

This is one of my U10 team's favorite shooting drills. It keeps everyone's attention, and gives everyone a chance to get a lot of quick shots on goal.

## Setup

Set up a 5 yard by 5 yard "shooting" square, marked with cones, at the inside of the top of the penalty area. Then, you'll form a "star" of cones around the square in the middle by placing a cone about 3-4 yards in from each corner flag, then a cone about 3-4 yards from each top corner of the penalty area, and the last cone about 10-15 yards above the center shooting square. See the diagram below; starting from the left corner, the star cones are numbered 1-5.

Feel free to adjust the distances of the star cones to the shooting square to suit the needs of your age group.

Evenly distribute soccer balls between the 5 star cones. You may need or want as many soccer balls as you can get to keep the speed of play goingâ€”helping with conditioning. Assistant coaches can help you retrieve balls from missed shots.

|                         |
```

## Players

You'll need a minimum of 6 players and a goalkeeper. Five of the players will line up at each of the numbered star cones, and one will be assigned the "striker" inside the shooting square.

If you have more than 6 players and a goalkeeper, distribute the players as evenly as possible in a line behind each of the star cones.

## How to Play

Play begins with a pass from the player at cone 1 to the striker inside the shooting square. The striker will receive the ball, turn and take a shot from inside the square as quickly as possible. Then, the player at cone 2 will make a pass to the striker, who will receive, turn and shoot again. And so on through cone number 5.

Once the stiker has taken 5 shots, the players rotate counter-clockwise to the next numbered cone, and cone 5 will move into the shooting square to be the next striker.

If you have more than the 6 players, players will rotate to the back of their respective lines.

The goal is to score as many goals as possible with a high tempo. Quick turn. Quick shot. Quick recovery for the next pass.

## Duration

You can play for 15 to 20 minutes, or until every player has had 2-3 turns as striker.

## Coaching Points

- Checking away from the area first, to make space for receiving and turning
- Turning quickly with good control
  - Inside of the foot turning
  - Outside of the foot turning
- Setting up your shot
  - Make sure to get the ball in a position for a solid strike as quickly as possible
- Follow up rebounds!
- Quick recovery as you locate the next pass
- Communication from striker and passers
