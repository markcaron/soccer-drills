# World Cuppies

## Purpose

World Cuppies is a fun, competitive and almost beautifully chaotic game that your team will love! In this 2 (or 3) versus the world, your players will work on dribbling (1v1, 1v2, etc), passing (and providing support), and shooting.

I use this game and [Power Finesse](power-finesse.md) as a reward for hard work during training sessions or for an end-of-season fun activity! I loved it as a kid, and every team I've ever coached begs me to play it at the end of every practice.

## Setup

Collect as many soccer balls as possible and put them in the goal (as reserves).

Create a goal crease arc about 6 yards from the center of the goal using 6-8 cones. You can also designate the 6 yard goal box as your goal crease. The purpose of the goal crease is to prevent players from shooting too close—no shots allowed inside the crease.

## Players

You'll need a goalkeeper, so you can either put in one of your goalkeepers or make one of the coaches a goalie. I find that having a coach as a goalkeeper allows the game to flow better, especially for younger kids.

Divide your team up into teams of 2 or 3 players each. As a kid, we always played teams of 2, but since coaching, I've found that 3 is less chaotic and allows for more "team play" (more passing and moving). Next, have each team pick a country to represent (it's the World Cup!).

If you have an extra player, you can either make one team that has an extra player (adding them to one of the weaker team—once play gets going it won't matter much) or you can choose to utilize your goalkeeper (if one of the coaches is playing goalkeeper).

## How to Play

The players/teams will spread out (outside of the crease) and wait for the coach to release the ball. When ready, the coach announces, "ball in!" and can throw, punt or roll the ball anywhere (at random or to an empty spot on the field).

Once the ball is in play, it's 2 (or 3) versus everyone else!

If the teams are struggling, the coach can pick up a second ball, announce "ball in!" and serve the ball into play as well. This can be used to speed up the game too since it will split the amount of defenders in 2 and create 2 points of attack.

__Game rules__
- When a ball goes out of bounds or when a shot misses, the coach will immediately get a new ball, announce "ball in!" and send it into play.
- Have an assistant coach or parent(s) help retrieve balls (putting them inside the net). You can also make the player who kicked the ball out of bounds retrieve it before returning to play.
- When a team scores, that team gets to rest behind the goal and get water. They can also help retrieve balls too while they wait.
- The last remaining team is eliminated, and a new round begins with the teams that scored.
- The game is played until all teams are eliminated except one __or__ you can choose to make the final 3 teams play sudden death (first team to score).
- Goals cannot be scored from shots inside the crease!

## Progressions & Variations

- You can have the teams call out their country's name as they score (or it doesn't count).
- For older kids, you can optionally only allow crosses to headers inside the crease (if you want to encourage that aspect in training) or tap-ins from a teammate's pass.

## Duration

You can play for as long as you like. This game is exhausting, so 15 minutes is pretty typical. But, be prepared for your players to keep wanting to play more and more rounds!

## Coaching Points

- Encourage 1v1s. Players should try to take defenders on!
- Encourage quick passing, like give-and-gos or wall passes.
- Encourage communication, especially if a team's players are split defending two different balls in play.
- If you want to encourage crosses for older kids, try the "headers only within the crease" variation above.
